Task:

Products should consist of the following:

Product Number (generated and unique)
Product Name
Product Category
Expiration Date

For this exercise, you will provide 3 sets of your own data (25 products each for a total of 75,) which will be displayed on your GitHub page for this project. Please describe why you chose the Mock data you used for your project and how that would cover a wide, reasonable, testable data set. 

After the data is entered in to the pattern, the program should then be able to do 1 of the following:

1.	Add 25 more products
2.	Return a listing of all products sorted by one of the product data points (ie all products sorted by Product Number, Product Name, etc
3.	Delete all products by specific data point (ie all products of a specific Product Number, Product Name, etc)


To Test your program, you should provide a test case or Main method which shows your program doing the following:
1.	Add the first data set
2.	Return Products Sorted by Name
3.	Add the next 25
4.	Return Products Sorted by Category
5.	Add the next 25
6.	Return Products Sorted by Expiration Date
7.	Delete All products of a specific Category
8.	Return Products Sorted by Product Number

Reason for choosing the data that i have used in the project:

I have choosen a data from a ecommerce website i thought that would be more realistic data.
